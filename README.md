# Modelling traffic jam

This repository contains classes allowing to model Optimal velocity model (OVM) and Intelligent driver model (IDM).

The notebooks have been tested with python 3.9.7 on MacOSX. Please don't try to render figures to pgf, as it may result in bugs.

## Dependencies

The only dependencies are numpy and matplotlib.

## Implementation

The two models are in the directory `models`. To see examples on how to use them, look onto the notebooks in the root directory. They are  named after the model they are testing / running.  
Some figures have been renamed between the runs, you may want to edit the filepaths in the notebooks to render different figures.
